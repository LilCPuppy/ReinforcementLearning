# ReinforcementLearning
A project-driven self-study for RL.

The sections of this directory will be very heavily based on literature, and I will try to annotate each chapter with a set of notes that I have taken.
Please note, that this work is not mine, and I am referencing the literature to which the folders belong.  For example, the notes taken in /ReinforcementLearning/sutton_and_barto/chapter_one/ will pertain to the Chapter One of Sutton and Barto.
